# Diabetes Prediction using Pima Indians Dataset

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting **Type-2 Diabetes** using the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**, which contains medical data of **female patients only**. The aim is to analyze health indicators and build machine learning models to classify whether a patient is diabetic or not.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

* **Pregnancies**: Number of times the patient has been pregnant
* **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
* **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* **BMI**: Body Mass Index (weight in kg / height in m²)
* **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Genetic risk factor for diabetes
* **Age**: Age of the patient (years)
* **Outcome**: Target variable (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-diabetic)

## 🎯 Objective

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Preprocess and clean the dataset
* Train and evaluate machine learning models
* Predict diabetes outcomes based on medical attributes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Workflow

1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Handle missing or zero values
3. Feature scaling and selection
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

## ✅ Results

The trained models are evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting diabetes, with comparisons based on accuracy and performance metrics.
